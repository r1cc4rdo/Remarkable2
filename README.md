# Remarkable 2 templates and resources
Use the provided ```install.sh``` script to upload the suspension cover and templates provided in this repository.

The script will ask you for your Remarkable ssh password twice, once for downloading a pristine copy of the ```templates.json``` file, the second to upload the files to the device.

Refer to the page [SSH Access on the reMarkableWiki](https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh) for instructions on how to set passwordless login.
